<h2> Animator Example </h2>

Example python script implementing animator module to create an animation of a cat and food bowl.

The sprites used for this animation are stored within the 'Sprites' folder and the animation frames created 
from the script are stored in the 'Cat_Animation_Frames' folder.

To keep the size of the repository small, only the frames corresponding to one second intervals of the
animation are stored in the 'Cat_Animation_Frames' folder. To compensate for this, a mp4 file was uploaded
to give an idea of how the full animation should play. Also all sprites used in the animation are avialable 
in the 'sprite' folder so all frames of the animation can be recreated if desired.
